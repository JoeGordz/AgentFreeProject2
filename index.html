								<h2>Ideation Process</h2>
							</header>
<p>Week 1:</p>

							<p>Moving forward from project 1 I am still going with the same focus on creating a website that allows athletes and coaches to set up profiles to communicate and find each other. In this project I want to focus on a way where users can set up profiles that can be visible to others. I also want to create a way where users can message each other after they have found someone they are interested in getting in contact with, where they can receive and send messages - Both of these ideas that link together and have been inspired by ‘STARNOW’, the website I talked about in project one where you can create profiles as either an actor or a agent and communicate with each other. I have ideas in my head of the interface looking like my mock designs from project one </p>
<p>**INSPIRATION**</p>

<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Screen Shot 2020-08-18 at 1.27.21 PM.png" alt="" /></a>
							<p>Week 2:</p>

							<p>I want to expand on these ideas and show them off well in this project. I want to create a mock database of athletes and coaches and display how they can find each other and how they can interact and look at each other's profiles and from there can message each other. Another Idea I had is that I want to incorporate is when you first open the website you are given the option to set up your account as an athlete or a coach/manager/scout and from there you have different options and different interfaces depending on what option you chose. I do want a way where you can easily switch, so I will create a little logo in the top right of the screen which tells you what account you are on and you can click it to switch if need be. For the look of the designs I want the interface to be really clean so it's easy to navigate and look sleek.  </p>

<p>I have also asked all my friends if they would allow me to put their faces on my website and they were all happy for me to do so. This means I can have multiple sports with various players to mock up as users on the database.

								<h2>Prototyping</h2>
							</header>

						<p>Week 2:</p>

							<p>I am a bit nervous about my skills of coding to be able to pull off a prototype for my AgentFree website. I am going to ask the tutor next week what is the best way to go about creating my prototype and how I can pull it off without having advanced coding skills. I am hoping there is a different way to prototype or an easier way whilst using HTML. </p>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Sketch2.jpg" alt="" /></a>

								<p>I made some sketches to make a plan of what the some of the feautures will consist of and how the features can link together well.  </p>

<p>Week 3:</p>
							<p>I talked to my tutor about the best way of tackling the prototyping aspect of this project, I told him I wasn't very comfortable with prototyping my project in HTML, he said to me he liked the interface mock designs I did for project one and recommended I used Adobe XD to prototype my website interface. This is the first time I had heard of the software but he basically said you can use photoshop to create a prototype for the interface. I downloaded it and watched a few tutorials on how it works and I'm pretty sure this is how I'm going to make my prototype.</p>

							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/Sketch3.jpg" alt="" /></a>
							<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/initalinterface.jpg" alt="" /></a>

								<p>I did some more sketching for my interface, I created a way to make different profiles dependent on how you want to use the website, an athlete or a coach and then developed them further and created them in photoshop.  </p>

<p>Early Week 4:</p>
							<p>I have started using Adobe XD and am really enjoying the software. I think it's perfect for me as I have quite a bit of experience in photoshop so designing the interface is great because I can make it in photoshop and bring it over to XD to prototype. </p>

								<a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/messaging.jpg" alt="" /></a>

								<p>I did some work on database interface design and developing my messaging system I mocked up in project 1 </p>
<p>Middle Week 4:</p>
							<p>
I have finished creating all my photoshop files and have made them work in Adobe XD, I am happy I have created a way to show off the two different ways to use the website. I was very nervous at the start about not being able to show off my ideas the way I wanted but am content with what I have created.
 </p> 
 <a href="#" class="image featured"><img src="images/PROTOTYPE.png" alt="" /></a>

								<p> After finishing all my photoshop files I put them into Adobe XD and placed them in order to make it easy for me to prototype them, I then linked everything together to finish my prototype of my website. </p>

							<p>Here is my final prototype if you were to use the website as a coach/manager/scout. I am really happy with how I got to display all the features I wanted to include and created more than I thought I could in my initial ideations and developed the ones I already had further. </p>

<p>Here is my final prototype if you were to use the website as an athlete. I think I could have worked on this aspect a little more and made the database look a bit better but I am still happy that I was able to produce two ways of using the website.
