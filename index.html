								<h2>Ideation Process</h2>
							</header>
<p>Week 1:</p>

							<p>Moving forward from project 1 I am still going with the same focus on creating a website that allows athletes and coaches to set up profiles to communicate and find each other. In this project I want to focus on a way where users can set up profiles that can be visible to others. I also want to create a way where users can message each other after they have found someone they are interested in getting in contact with, where they can receive and send messages - Both of these ideas that link together have been inspired by ‘STARNOW’ the website I talked about in project one where you can create profiles as either an actor or a agent and communicate with each other. I have ideas in my head of the interface looking like my mock designs from project one </p>

							<p>Week 2:</p>

							<p>I want to expand on these ideas and show them off well in this project. I want to create a mock database of athletes and coaches and display how they can find each other and how they can interact and look at each other's profiles and from there can message each other. Another Idea I had is that I want to incorporate is when you first open the website you are given the option to set up your account as an athlete or a coach/manager/scout and from there you have different options and different interfaces depending on what option you chose. I do want a way where you can easily switch, so I will create a little logo in the top right of the screen which tells you what account you are on and you can click it to switch if need be. For the look of the designs I want the interface to be really clean so it's easy to navigate and look sleek.  </p>

<p>I have also asked all my friends if they would allow me to put their faces on my website and they were all happy for me to do so. This means I can have multiple sports with various players to mock up as users on the database.

								<h2>Prototyping</h2>
							</header>

						<p>Week 2:</p>

							<p>I am a bit nervous about my skills of coding to be able to pull off a prototype for my AgentFree website. I am going to ask the tutor next week what is the best way to go about creating my prototype and how I can pull it off without having advanced coding skills. I am hoping there is a different way to prototype or an easier way whilst using HTML. </p>

<p>Week 3:</p>
							<p>I talked to my tutor about the best way of tackling the prototyping aspect of this project, I told him I wasn't very comfortable with prototyping my project in HTML, he said to me he liked the interface mock designs I did for project one and recommended I used Adobe XD to prototype my website interface. This is the first time I had heard of the software but he basically said you can use photoshop to create a prototype for the interface. I downloaded it and watched a few tutorials on how it works and I'm pretty sure this is how I'm going to make my prototype.</p>
<p>Early Week 4:</p>
							<p>I have started using Adobe XD and am really enjoying the software. I think it's perfect for me as I have quite a bit of experience in photoshop so designing the interface is great because I can make it in photoshop and bring it over to XD to prototype. </p>
<p>Middle Week 4:</p>
							<p>
I have finished creating all my photoshop files and have made them work in Adobe XD, I am happy I have created a way to show off the two different ways to use the website. I was very nervous at the start about not being able to show off my ideas the way I wanted but am content with what I have created.

								<h2>Development</h2>
							</header>

							<p>AgentFree is a hands-on tool aimed not only at Young male or female Athletes who are looking to make a career out of the sport but also Young Athletes who want to be recognised by better teams and coaches.  AgentFree will appeal to a teen looking for a scholarship to a school, or someone looking for a team overseas, or even in their own region or their own Club. No matter how old they are, how good of an athlete they are or what sport they play, AgentFree is inclusive to everyone. AgentFree has a secondary market among Agents and Managers who want to recruit new talent to their stable and also among Coaches and Managers looking for a new up and coming athlete.</p>

							<p>My first inspiration for the Website was an awareness that some young sports people struggled to find the next move after leaving their College or Club Teams. Unless they had been in expensive Academies they had little chance of being “discovered” or offered scholarships overseas or even to be noticed by Clubs when they moved to new cities or wanted to move on up to one of the higher grades in a better Club. </p>

<p>The sort of promotion required is not dissimilar to promoting and marketing Talent to the Film and Television industry.  StarNow is a website where aspiring actors, independent of an agent, pay for a profile so that they can be found and they can also submit their profiles to Casting Directors who place job opportunities on the site.
